# GifTastic
• I made an Array of actions and a button for each at the top of the page.
• When the button is clicked 10 images will be retreived from the Giphy.com site with a rating for each image.
• The images will appear as standing still but when the image is clicked the gif will play and when clicked again the gif stops playing.
• You can add a new Gif Button from the search tool on the right side of the page. It will be added to the search options at the top of the page.
• This tool is useful for searching only 10 Gif's per button.
